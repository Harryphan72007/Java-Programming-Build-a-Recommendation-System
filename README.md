🎬 Movie Recommender System (Java)

This repository contains my work for the course Java Programming: Build a Recommendation System, where I implemented a movie recommendation engine using collaborative filtering techniques in Java.

The project analyzes user ratings to recommend movies a user is likely to enjoy based on similarities between users.
📚 Course Overview

📚 Course Information

This project was completed as part of
Java Programming: Build a Recommendation System, offered on
Coursera

The course emphasizes:

Object-Oriented Programming in Java

Data structures and collections

Algorithmic thinking

Building recommender systems from scratch

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java

Object-Oriented Design

CSV data processing

HTML output for web-based recommendations

🚀 Project Features

Stores and manages movie ratings using a RaterDatabase

Calculates similarity scores between users

Recommends movies using collaborative filtering

Supports filters such as:

Minimum number of raters

Movie attributes (via filters)

Outputs recommendations as an HTML table for web display

🧠 Core Concepts Implemented

Dot product similarity

Weighted average ratings

Filtering and sorting recommendations

Separation of concerns using multiple classes:

FourthRatings

MovieDatabase

RaterDatabase

Filter interfaces

📄 Example Output

The recommender produces an HTML table displaying:

Ranked movie recommendations

Movie titles

Recommendation scores

If no recommendations are available, the system gracefully informs the user.

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained experience with:

Designing modular Java programs

Implementing recommendation algorithms

Working with real-world datasets

Generating dynamic HTML from Java
